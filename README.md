# Citation-Weights-based-on-Citation-Contexts-Semantic-Similarity
This python script was used for finding the semantic similarity between pairs of citation contexts as to part of doctoral thesis (https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/8008/). The thesis proposed two citations weighting schemes that are based on the semantic similarity between citation contexts.
Citation mention count, which is the number of times a cited publication is mentioned in the citing paper, is a popular method for weighting contribution of citations, it however does not take into account citation contexts information (the wording associated with the in-text citations). The doctoral thesis proposes a more nuanced weighting method that incorporates citation contexts into citation mention count. 
Secondly, this study exploits the citation context information to create a system for weighting residual citation, where residual citations are accumulated by a publication depending on its contributions to other publications on its citation path. Conversely, on a citation path A-B-C, publication A was cited by publication B and publication C cited publication B, publication A contributed to publication C if the citation context of publication A in publication B is similar to the citation context of publication B in publication C.
